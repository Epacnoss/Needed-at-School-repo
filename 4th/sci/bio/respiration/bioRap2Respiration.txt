Respiration is good,
it keeps you alive.
Without doing it,
you would simply die.

You, need oxygen and glucose
to make water, and carbon dioxide.
And then ATP as well,
which can be used as a cell currency.

Oxygen is given by the lungs and blood,
and glucose through our food.
Carbon dioxide goes out the lungs,
And water stays in the blood and cells.

ATP is used as energy to do work,
and is used as a cell currency.
We can also make it without O2,
it just doesn't work as well.

Aerobic respiration can be measured,
using a, respirometer.
It moves a bead of food dye,
using pressure and soda lime.

Anaerobic respiration makes lactic acid,
which feels bad for muscles.
The only way to get rid of it,
is to breathe some more.

Peas, seeds, all living things respire,
without it they couldn't have energy.
All thanks to some alien organisms,
called mitochondria, they respire.

The singular of mitochondria,
it is mitochondrion.
And if you mess that up,
you may as well say 'amount'

The author of this rap,
was Jacky Mag.
The author never wants,
that name to be used again.
