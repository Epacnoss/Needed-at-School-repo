Three vital ingredients:
water, sun, co2
NOTHING else

plants turn this into food for growth and o2, called photosynthesis.
Took over 400 years to figure out why sun, water, why must have co2.

today, photosyn at the front of science.

taking place in every leaf of every plant.

the uni of oxford garden is v. old

the narrator lives there and is director.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

seed -> tree - took a long time to figure out.

in 1800s, people asked why plants grow.

van helmont story...
science seen as a threat to god.
trouble comes knocking to the door in the spanish conquestadors.
....................
in bk.

HE WAS WRONG.

water is important, but not necessary

---------------------------------------------------

in 1675, a map of the oxford botanical garden, there were no windows!
ha!
it shows that 17 century botantists, have not cracked the miracle of sun yet....
they thought that plants grew on gods will.

---------------------------------------------------

in 1779 a dutch botanist took a coach to London, and he would change the world, he was called Yang Ingenhaus.
He was a smallpox inncoulator.
well-paid job, so he can get a nice country house, planning to write a bk on smallpox.
however the countryside distracted him.
he looked at the plants.

in late c18, scientists investigated gases.
One said that plants give off gases, so Ingenhaus did an experiment - he collected leaves from his garden, and put them underwater to wait for bubbles.
He believes that any gas will rise giving bubbles.
he couldn't get any to give gases off,
until one worked whilst in sun............
after just 10 mins, lots of tiny bubbles of gas are emerging.
he has made the connection between plants and sun.
what is the gas tho fam, he said.
The gases collect at the top of the glass, and he sticks in a burning splint, re-igniting it.
He KNOWS it is significant, and in frenzied hurries, he experimented more and more. NB: intervention trial, in that he placed one leaf in sun and one in shade.
he tested all from his garden, and even one from cocoa from the london kew garden.
but is it light or heat - so he placed some near an open fire, and no bubbles appear.
this confirms that it is light NOT heat.

An intervention trial, without placebo effect, or pre-conceived notions largely affecting results, as well as a very large sample size, and he determined that the process was universal...

he arrived a doctor, and left a botanist

who woulda thunk it.

---------------------------------------------------

it would be 100 years before another leap.

The man behind it was called Julia Sacks.
He has a passion for plants....

as a schoolboy, he loves nature, but not science, just plants.
just before school, everyday, he just collects and records his local flora.

when he was 17, his mother, father and a brother, all die in a year.
he is penniless, and a fam friend gives a job at the uni of Prague
he needs to work long hours, but it gives him an understanding of the rigorous scientific process.
he had money to live, but not for plants.
he turns to drugs.

over the next few years, he conducts 1000s of experiments and keeps rigorous detail.
he made a textbook, with all about gases, waters, and sun.
it became the standard txtbook and is even translated to Eng.
A true magus opus.
offers of work flooooooooooood in.

in german he is appointed head of europe's botanical institute at 36.
he has his own research group, with a large obsession.
drugs haven't left, but he is still driven.
HOW DO THEY GROW
now he has money to pursue the question.

cocaine was his poison

his desire is all-consuming.
why is sun so important.
one of his best-known experiments:
	what is in a normal leaf?
	he takes off the green colour, and adds iodine to react with starch. it is black - covered in starch
	now he does it with a sun-deprived leaf, but it is white - no starch	
	finally does it with part and part sun and no-sun, and ............
	DRUMROLL PLS
	it is only black where the light went through.
	light=starch
	shade=no starch
he doesn't stop there tho.
he got a new microscope and saw choloroplasts, and the energy produced within makes seeds, flowers, fruits and everything.
looking at living chlrpdsts, they move for optimal sun-catching - as sun hits a leaf, the chlrpdsts FIGHT. just the right amount of light - goldilocks style

---------------------------------------------------

now scientists know about oxygen, soil, chlrpdsts - all in 200yrs.
yet to find co2 tho....

ITS STOMATA TIME BABY

---------------------------------------------------

andrew benson, found v. important.
melvin calvin, his boss, a good chemist.
both at uni of california.
they were both investigating what co2 was used for.

benson didn't know about all w/ calvin, and had his own pet theory - he was focusing on that, rather than benson
benson just saw his boss pursuing what HE KNEW to be a dead end.....................

they worked closely, and cyclotron helps.....
allows us to study nucleus atom, but produces radioactive carbon atoms as well.
if the atom is radioactive we can follow it
the idea is to replace normal co2 with carbon radioactive co2.
benson believes he can track it.
he can find how it is used........

at the centre of the experiment was a large glass bowl (v thin tho), with happy algae photosynthesising perfectly.
there were two carbon making plates to the side.
diag:

|   !!   |
|   !!   |
|   !!   |
|   !!   |


he gave them the c atoms and killed the algae using alcohol.
the reaction with alcohol freezes time in the cell, and so he can see how the algae are using it.
he examines it with sheets of paper and it produces a chromatogram.
THINE EUREKA MOMENT
the picture had each different stage of how to make SUGAR he he he he he he the ebuifbaiufyghquysfkhdf7iguydkhiaset7oy8gukyxvchfiugtkuyvebgsdfukbhlk

calvin is still uninterested.
benson doesn't say anything.
calvin is proved wrong.
benson is proved right.

not one big step, but lots of small steps, and this takes 10 yrs.
benson has no recognition, and calvin gets credit.
he is sacked, leaving calvin to work on without him.
calvin gets a nobel prize,
but benson isn't there...............................................
to begin with they are both credited, but eventually calvin gets it all.
his autoboigraphy gives NO mention of benson.
ENSURE 4 YEAR FEUD

Calvin is immomorizalized in the calvin cycle, how it all works, but some still recognise benson, and call it the calvin-benson cycle.
they filled a huge gap in our knowledge.
comparable to crick & watson w/ DNA

---------------------------------------------------

now we can even watch plants grow, cell by cell
we still don't know everything tho...
like how plants can grow everywhere the same.....

---------------------------------------------------

eg. ivy, w/ no water or sun, yet it adapts to grow.
plants adapt to make the best of their surroundings, cos they are rooted.
ADAPT OR DIE

we can turn this to our advantage.....
he he he he heh heh heh

eg. lightbulbs in greenhouses for 24/7 growing.
by changing the light they can eg. change peppers growing season by 4 wks!!!
changing co2 levels can also affect like CRAZY

one greenhouse produces half of all UK's tomatoes (why not sabotage it heh heh heh)
next to it is a factory, which has two by-products, steam and co2.
the steam goes out to the atmo,
but co2 can't go there (smth about climate change maybe), so it is pumped to the greenhouse
it has tubes with tiny holes which give co2 to the tomatoes.
they make more SUGAR, which is good for us, and doubles the yield...

---------------------------------------------------

we can grow more food, by changing conditions, and growers have photosynthesis down to a fine art.
it can be manipulated, but the plants still do everything.
the amount of light energy converted is CRRRAZY, in that in 1 year, if the energy was harvested it could power all of civilisation 6 times over.

this is just the start tho - people are trying to recreate chloroplasts, to make fuels of the future.
maybe we could take co2 from atom to fuel.....
clean and limitless energy.....

---------------------------------------------------

fun fact - half of photosynthesis is done in the sea.
