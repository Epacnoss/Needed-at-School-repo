Enzymes are good,
they keep you alive.
Without them,
you would simply die.

They are made of stuff,
like amino acids.
And have a substrate,
and a complementary shape.

There is a key,
to their lock.
It is called the reactant,
and it makes a product.

There are different enzymes,
they all end in -aze.
If you no like lactose,
You are missing lactase.

There is also amylaze,
to break down sugar.
And there is protease,
to break down aminos.

The enzyme is a catalyst,
nothing more.
If it weren't to exist,
you wouldn't be no more.

Enzymes are in and out,
of the different cells.
One is called exterior enzyme,
the other interior.

The author of this rap,
was Jacky Mag.
The author never wants,
that name to be used again.
